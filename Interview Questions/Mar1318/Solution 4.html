/*

You have a player that can move within a 2d space that is 20x20 in area.
The player starts at 0,0
Your player can only move one space at a time (N, S, E, W).
The player can only enter a box where the digits of the row is greater than 8.

i.e. (20,20) = 2+0+2+0 = 4 = valid move
     (15, 5) = 1+5+5 = 11 = invalid move

Find out how many blocks the player can reach in this instance?

Answer = 45 (9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1)

Can you write a program that varies the area and the threshold?

*/

//start at 0,0 and move right

//if the sum of the digits is less than x, mark your current spot as passable

//repeat

//once you can no longer go right - move down

//if moving down is not valid, increment the y axis and start fresh

//if it is a valid move, keep moving right and down again until you stop

//then go to the next y axis


<script>
    function matrixCounter(rows, columns, threshold){
        var m = rows;
        var n = columns;
        var x = threshold;

        var matrix = createMatrix(m, n);

    }

    function createMatrix(m, n){
        //create the matrix here

    }
</script>
